# IKV Optimization – Code Showcase

This repo displays the Python source for an optimization script.
**Viewing only** — no environment is needed to read the code in GitHub.

## What it uses (if you want to run it)
- Python 3.x
- [FINE](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/FINE)

- A linear solver:
  - **GUROBI** (current license expired),
  - or open-source alternatives: **HiGHS** (`pip install highspy`), **GLPK**, **CBC**.

> The repository is primarily for **code display**. Running requires installing FINE, Pyomo, and a solver.
